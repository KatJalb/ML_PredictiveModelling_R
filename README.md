# Machine Learning traffic explaining modelling using R

## Description of the project
> The main aim of this project is to apply various ML algorithms to build a model explaining the traffic on one of the highways for one-hourly intervals based on the training sample and generate predictions for all observations from the test sample.

## Algorithms used
- Linear regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
- LASSO Regression and Elastic net
